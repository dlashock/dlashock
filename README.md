## 🚀 About Me

I'm an IT Director actively transitioning into software engineering and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Currently deepening my programming skills through hands-on projects and structured learning, with a focus on building reliable, scalable systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

- **Languages:** Go, Python, JavaScript
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana
- **Platforms:** Unraid, Linux, Home Lab Infrastructure
- **Learning:** Full-stack development, SRE practices, System Architecture

## 📚 Current Learning Path

I'm following a structured curriculum through [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) while building real-world projects. My focus areas include:
- Backend development with Go and Python
- Container orchestration and monitoring
- Infrastructure as Code and automation
- Building production-ready applications

## 🔨 Featured Projects

### 🏠 **Home Lab Infrastructure**
Production home lab running 29+ containerized services on Dell PowerEdge hardware. Implementing SRE practices including monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), automation, and reliability engineering.

### 🎮 **Pokédex CLI** (Go)
Interactive command-line application featuring intelligent caching, concurrent operations, and clean architecture patterns. Integrates with PokéAPI for real-time data.

### 🤖 **AI Code Assistant** (Python)
Gemini-powered development assistant with sandboxed code execution, file management, and intelligent code analysis capabilities.

### 🕸️ **Static Site Generator** (Python)
